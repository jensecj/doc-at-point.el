;;; Commentary:

;; Simple functionality for showing documentation for the symbol at point.

;; Customizing the information show is done by registering backends using
;; `doc-at-point-register', which takes a mode (or a list of modes) where that
;; backend should be active, and two functions `symbol-fn', and `doc-fn', which
;; recognize the symbol-at-point, and fetch the documentation-string for that
;; symbol, respectively.

;;; Code:

(require 'map)

(defvar doc-at-point-alist '()
  "Alist of plists.
KEY is the mode registred with a backend.

VALUE is a plist of `(:symbol-fn :doc-fn :should-run-p :order)'.

:SYMBOL-FN = () -> symbol: returns the symbol-at-point.

:DOC-FN = symbol -> string: returns documentation for a symbol.

:SHOULD-RUN-P = nil | t | (() -> nil | t): whether the backend
should be used, can be a symbol or a predicate.

:ORDER [number]: The ordering of the backend. Backends are
checked for if they should run from lowest order to highest. ")
